Arrow Solution Kit:
This reposistory should eventually house all of the code relating to the Arrow solution kits.

Remote Monitoring:
The following bundles are used by remote monitoring:
-xbee-api: the JNI-ified and ECLIPSE-ified XBeeAPI
-log4jlib_osgi: the JNI-ified log4jlib bundle (taken from bugnet), requred by xbee-api
-RemoteMonDemoSimple: A simple version of the demo code, not using com.buglabs.xbee
-com.buglabs.xbee: a daemon and wrapper for xbee-api, abstracting away the XBee-related datastructures
-RemoteMonDemoAPI: the functionality of RemoteMonDemoSimple, but using com.buglabs.xbee
